### MailChimp {#mailchimp}



Here you can setup MailChimp settings for subscribe widget.

##### MailChimp API Key

If you want to set up an integration with your MailChimp account, you'll need to generate an API key, and insert in this field.

##### MailChimp List ID

Each MailChimp list has a unique List ID that integrations, plugins, and widgets may require to connect and transfer subscriber data.

After the template installation you'll see the following message: "Please set up MailChimp API key and List ID" instead of the subscribe and follow form.
